My name is Shubham Agrawal. I came from a very small city of Bokaro Steel City, named as Phusro. And currently I am pursuing my B.Tech from Gandhi Institute of Engineering & Technology (a well – reputed college of Odisha). Here I got an occasion to speak something about love is a motivation. But before proceeding this seminar as a motivational speech. I would like to clarify you the differences between motivations, motivating and motivated through one of the fresh incidence of my life.<br>

<br>Like many others before me. I came to Odisha at GIET Gunupur with my dreams. The college belongs to a Professional Engineering institute, but apart from this my dream was different. The biggest one was to become a writer and I was so passionate to fulfill it, with this seminar has made this one dream come true. You might would be thinking that if I want to be a desired writer than why I had joined an engineering college? And I must say that there is a long story behind this which you will going to read it on upcoming years. But even after a lot of struggle I couldn’t do it justice. Everything I wrote seems lacking it was loquacious but still that was not my point. So I tore up my approved article of my speech at today morning and committed myself that whatever I’ll speak, I’ll speak with my heart. I came to the college on last year. But in last two months something happened very strange. I began to feel a strange love for this college as if it’s my own.<br>

<br>What lay at the core of this Love?<br>

<br>This exciting college, new friends, or my bizarre independence? What has this college given me that make me love her so? Actually the answer had been quite apparent it had been in front of my eyes just a few steps ahead of me, but I had not noticed it for the last one year.<br>

<br>I JUST DIDN’T SEE.<br>

<br>I met someone for the first time at the beginning of my 3rd semester classes…my friend, a girl, a stranger, a new class mate, a companion, just someone. I did not so want to know about her goals and ambitions she belongs to a Telugu culture family. She have lots of restrictions and rules in the family but she sure knew how to enjoy her life. When I look back I wonder if the joy of being a writer would have been the same without her thoughts, I look back at the lonely nights made less lonely by trying to find more of her.<br>

<br>When I had first come here I had my goals straight. My forte was music, programming, learning and writing. But now I know that the joy of achieving these goals is meaningful only when shared with someone else. It’s awesome sometimes while running after our goals being engrossed in one particular thing we lose sight of many things that really matter. Only now do I see that my straight love for this college is actually one with my love for this person! So closes your eyes for a second. Look for your special someone and see the world through their eyes. You’ll see that this little world is even more beautiful than you ever imagined. Who knows even you might get a new friend like me. Never let your dreams pass by spin them in to reality.<br>

<br><font face="monotype corsiva" size="5" color="antiquewhite">This new friend has changed my whole world into a festoon. Love is pure and true when you can support the only you love, no matter where it takes them or how crazy their dreams may sound. Love is always being there but also catching them if they fall. Don’t give up on the people you love. Give them support. Your patience and help may be exactly what they need to make a complete turnaround. True love is always eternal, infinite and always like itself. It is seen with white hairs and is always young in the heart. Love doesn’t need a reason. Love without reason. Wake up every morning with the thought that something wonderful is about to happen! Miracles always happens when you believe.”</font><br>
