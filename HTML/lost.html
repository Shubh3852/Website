My 4 months girlfriend gave up on me about two weeks ago. We had been dating for almost two months and we had been friends since five months. Everything was perfectly fine. We would talk about love, getting married and having kids and all of our lives together. Then one day out of the blue, she gave up on me. She claimed that she had a family problem. As our cultures doesn’t match, our caste doesn’t match but honey our blood colors, our being human matches. We both are having problems of same kind “FAMILY” but this does not mean that we have to give up on each other. Yes I do agree that family should be the first priority but the only thing is matter that how we can convince them. Clapping is done by two hands. If any one of in a relation will start giving up on others then the pure meaning of love will never be possible appropriately. Just be with the person who makes you priority not an option.<br>

<br>I didn’t understand how she could so easily throw me away and forget me after having these many memories, and still I don’t. I don’t understand how she cannot care about how badly it hurt me and well, just not care in general. I lost my faith in love. The day when I saw her is just the reverse of the day what is now. She is having the same glow, same smile, and same beauty in her face. But there is something on me which I lost like anything. I committed to myself that I can’t live like this anymore. For the first time when I met her accidently not knowing that we could turn like this ever. It is all over between us but internally I don’t feel. Somehow I believed that I still love her even then, even now. But the worst feeling is when someone makes you feel special then suddenly leaves you hanging and you have to act like you don’t care. I just wish I could give you my pain just for one moment. Not to hurt you, but so that you could finally understand how much you hurt me.<br>

<br>Today I found her in the crowd of bus. We looked at each other. She sat just behind of me. But both of us want to look on other sides. There was lot of things to say, yet I remained silent. Because things were not the same this time. My internal soul wants to hear her voice. But she didn’t even approached for once. And this made me remembered of those nameless moments and days that we spent together. I don’t want to felt lackadaisical but that was the first time when I didn’t able to control on my emotions. And tears were rolled down. I hid. I lost. I sullen. I sobered. Honestly I’ve never learned to hate and I don’t want her to be my lesson of hate.<br>
