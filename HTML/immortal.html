<br>I flipped through the last page of my diary which marked the end of the year. I sat by window watching snowflakes falling outside. Heaps of snow had deposited on the road. My hands shivered when I merely touched the window pane. The weather enthralled me. But I had something to sad about. With my favorite pen I started penning down those enigmatic thoughts that crossed my mind. The incident which happened with my one of closest friend.<br>

<br>Love in his life has not treated him well recently. His love is so pure and indeed. He is a boy with no regrets but plenty of pains. I remember the day when I saw him. That day there was something on him which captures my all concentration towards him. I asked his name, he didn’t answered. Then I knew from the peoples that In the midst of the ancient crowded city he was born. He was totally lost in his own world. There was something strange on him. He was completely lost but he was helping the beggars. Then after few days I saw him again. But this time when I said him ‘hello’, he replied me back. After passing 2 hours of time with him I came to know the story behind his being lost.<br>

<br>He narrated: “After a long time he saw her again. They were in the crowd. They looked at each other. Both of them want to say a lot of things, yet they remained silent. Because this time the things were not the same. She gave him the same smile and his eyes were not prepared to miss a single look of her. And he suddenly saw a ring on her finger, his heart beats became faster this time, he turned away in hope that it was an illusion of his eyes. She asked him if he is okay but he remain quite. She said her to talk her straight, looking deep into her eyes. And he remember of the first day when she said him “I love you” and he felt his entire world flip.  She was the frost that burnt him, she was the gravity that made him fly. She was his death but nothing made him feel more alive. But this is the last time when he took her face in his hands and had a long look. Maybe it was the last time he was appreciating the spark in her eyes he had madly fallen in love with. Maybe it was the last time he could touch her.<br> 

<br>She said: “I love my parents and I can’t go beyond of their words. No matter what they go through but I know at the end they’ll be happy. There will be a smile on their face.” She hid her pain again and she hid the truth that she love him so much to the extent that her lips can’t explain.<br>

<br>He don’t want to felt lackadaisical but that was the first time when he didn’t able to control on his emotions. And tears were rolled down. He hid. He lost. He sullen. With tears in his eyes he realized that he had to let her go. He was too precious for her to let go. He had seemed a bit aloof lately, she couldn’t fathom why. And in moment she passed away, with the same tease in her heart of losing a friend, losing a love, losing a hope. And tears rolled on from his eyes, wondering the time they’ve spent together.”<br>

<br><font face="monotype corsiva" size="5" color="crimson">After listening to him. I sober. I saw a kind of pain to his eyes. I saw he was really weeping. I saw no hopes to his eyes.<br>

<br>Dear Reader,<br>

<br>They weren’t afraid of anyone. The only fear they had was of losing friendship for a relationship. The losing happiness and smile of their parents. The bitter truth of the life is that when you got together, you learned about love. But when you broke up, you learned about life. And where there’s life, there’s hope. Sometimes we simply have to step back. Sometimes letting the love of our life go away is the strongest move we can take. It’s normal to miss someone when you are alone and lonely, But I suggest you all that happiness begins with you, not with your relationship.</font><br>
